# ticket-to-ride-imports

Import jobs for loading [CSV data](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ticket-to-ride/blob/master/doc/export_format.md) from [Ticket to RIDE](http://github.com/codeforamerica/ticket-to-ride) into various school district student information systems.

## Project Structure

- `sis_notes`: Contains notes about installing and/or running import scripts on variables student information systems
- `(school name)`: There's a folder for each school that we're working with. Inside each folder are the import scripts and any additional instructions.

## SIS

If you're a school and looking to create your own import script, here is a listing of which schools might be good examples to start. (Bonus points if you're writing a script and submit a pull request to add it into this repo!)
